# CS639 Final - Idea Proposal
Names: Jimmy Karoly, Dhyey Dave, Naga Layanya Mukku

1. We are building this app to help with the financial literacy of college students. There isn't a push in most schools for financial education, and some students go to college unprepared to manage their finances. An app with small educational lessons and quizzes can help a student gain control of their finances.

2. We are targeting college students who need help making financial decisions and educating themselves on finance topics.

3. We want to build an app to help users quickly educate themselves on finance.

4. In the app, we want to include quizzes, videos, and information on different topics. We also want to include financial news and updates for the user.

5. Similar Apps:
### Zogo

This app is similar to what we want to create. It is an education/quiz app. The UI of the app is more advanced than we will be making but the concept is similar. 

### InvestMate

This is another similar app, though this focuses mainly on investment and stock market knowledge. 

6. What makes our app unique is that we want to add a way to push news and updates to users about the financial world.

7. We have identified 3 main risks:
        1. Privacy Concerns: if we decide to add a budget feature or a way for users to track their money we would need to ensure we can protect the privacy of all of our users.
        2. User Adoption: Even if we can successfully develop the app, there is a risk that users will not adopt it as intended. Lack of user adoption could lead to poor engagement and low user retention rates.
        3. Educational content: we need to make sure we have the right topics and content written in a way that is engaging with our potential users.
        
8. Our end goal with this project is to build familiarity with the android development system and gain experience in mobile app development. We want to build a nice final product to add to our portfolios.
